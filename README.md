# Regularization-Concepts

This project provides a brief demonstration on Ridge and Lasso regression techniques.

## Background

The project focuses on linear regression and aims to predict salary (y) based on years of experience (x). The training data consists of two data points, and the goal is to find the best fit line that passes through both points.

## Ridge Regression

Ridge regression is a regularization technique that helps to mitigate overfitting in linear regression models. It introduces a penalty term to the loss function, which controls the complexity of the model. By adding a regularization term, Ridge regression limits the impact of the predictor variables, preventing them from having extreme values.

## Lasso Regression

Similar to Ridge regression, Lasso regression is another regularization technique used to prevent overfitting in linear regression models. Lasso regression also adds a penalty term to the loss function, but it uses the L1 norm of the coefficients. This regularization technique encourages sparsity in the model by driving some of the coefficients to zero, effectively selecting a subset of the most important features.
